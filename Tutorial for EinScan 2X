# EinScan Pro 2X Tutorial
This tutorail is meant to get you started with your EinScan Pro 2X.  We did not find the included instructions very intuitive. This workflow is based on a few days of playing with the scanner and various vertebrate bones found in our lab. The key is to be patient and persistent.  Play with different settings to ge tthe desired outcome you are looking for.  We hope this tutorial gets you started.
